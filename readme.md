# Vecta
Library to convert Earth time to Phantasar time and vice versa


On the fictional world of Phantasar time is counted in Vectas and Millos.
20 Vecta is approx 24 hours and also the length of a day on Phantasar.
1000 Millos = 1 Vecta.

This library can convert this to hours/minutes/seconds and vice versa.
It's entirely written in C, but the header is also set up to be C++ compatible.
